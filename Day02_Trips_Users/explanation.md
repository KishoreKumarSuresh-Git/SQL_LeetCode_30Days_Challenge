### Explanation

#### Problem Summary
We need to calculate the daily cancellation rate for taxi requests where both the client and driver are unbanned. Cancellation rate is defined as the ratio of cancelled requests to total requests on a given day.

#### Approach
1. **Filter Relevant Data**:
   - Use the `Trips` table for trip data and the `Users` table to filter unbanned clients and drivers.
   - Only include trips within the date range '2013-10-01' to '2013-10-03'.

2. **Join Tables**:
   - Join the `Trips` table with the `Users` table twice:
     - For `client_id` → `users_id` (to filter unbanned clients).
     - For `driver_id` → `users_id` (to filter unbanned drivers).

3. **Classify Cancellations**:
   - Use the `status` column to identify cancelled trips (`cancelled_by_driver` or `cancelled_by_client`).

4. **Group by Date**:
   - Group data by `request_at` to calculate daily metrics.

5. **Compute Cancellation Rate**:
   - Use the formula:
     \[ \text{Cancellation Rate} = \frac{\text{Number of Cancelled Requests}}{\text{Total Number of Requests}} \]

6. **Round the Result**:
   - Round the cancellation rate to two decimal places using `ROUND()`.

#### SQL Techniques Used
- **Joins**: To filter unbanned users for both clients and drivers.
- **CASE Statements**: To classify and count cancelled requests.
- **Aggregation**: To calculate total and cancelled requests per day.
- **Rounding**: To format the cancellation rate to two decimal points.

#### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Joining tables: `O(n + m)` where `n` is the size of `Trips` and `m` is the size of `Users`.
  - Grouping and aggregation: `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Temporary space for joins and grouped results: `O(n + m)`.
